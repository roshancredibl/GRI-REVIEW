Goals for 2030,GOAL A,"The integrity, connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems are maintained, enhanced, or restored, substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050; Human-induced extinction of known threatened species is halted, extinction rate and risk reduced tenfold, and abundance of native wild species increased to healthy levels; Genetic diversity within populations of wild and domesticated species is maintained.",,
,GOAL B,"Biodiversity is sustainably used and managed and nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, are valued, maintained and enhanced, with those currently in decline being restored, supporting sustainable development for present and future generations by 2050.",,
,GOAL C,"Monetary and non-monetary benefits from the utilization of genetic resources, digital sequence information and traditional knowledge are shared fairly and equitably, including with indigenous peoples and local communities, substantially increased by 2050 while protecting traditional knowledge, contributing to conservation and sustainable use, in accordance with international access and benefit-sharing instruments.",,
,GOAL D,"Adequate means of implementation (financial resources, capacity-building, cooperation, technology access and transfer) are secured and equitably accessible to all Parties, progressively closing the biodiversity finance gap of $700 billion per year by 2050, aligning financial flows with this Framework and the 2050 Vision for biodiversity.",,
Targets for 2050 ,TARGET 1,"Ensure all areas are under participatory, integrated and biodiversity inclusive spatial planning and/or effective management addressing land- and sea-use change, to bring the loss of high biodiversity areas close to zero by 2030, respecting indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ rights.",,
,TARGET 2,"By 2030, at least 30% of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and marine and coastal ecosystems are under effective restoration, enhancing biodiversity, ecosystem functions, services, integrity and connectivity.",,
,TARGET 3,"By 2030, at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, marine and coastal areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem importance are effectively conserved and managed through well-connected, equitably governed systems of protected areas and other measures, recognizing indigenous and traditional territories, integrated in wider landscapes and seascapes, ensuring sustainable use consistent with conservation outcomes.",,
,TARGET 4,"Ensure urgent management to halt human induced extinction of known threatened species, recover and conserve species, reduce extinction risk, maintain and restore genetic diversity, including effective management of human-wildlife interactions to minimize conflict.",,
,TARGET 5,"Ensure sustainable, safe and legal use, harvesting and trade of wild species, preventing overexploitation, minimizing impacts on non-target species and ecosystems, reducing pathogen spillover risk, applying ecosystem approach, respecting customary sustainable use by indigenous peoples and local communities.",,
,TARGET 6,"Eliminate, minimize, reduce or mitigate impacts of invasive alien species by identifying and managing introduction pathways, preventing priority invasive species establishment, reducing other invasive introductions by at least 50% by 2030, eradicating or controlling invasive species especially in priority sites.",,
,TARGET 7,"Reduce pollution risks and negative impacts from all sources to levels not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions by 2030, including cutting excess nutrients lost by half, reducing risks from pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals by half, and preventing, reducing and working toward eliminating plastic pollution.",,
,TARGET 8,"Minimize impact of climate change and ocean acidification on biodiversity and increase resilience through mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk reduction, nature-based and ecosystem-based approaches, while minimizing negative and fostering positive climate action impacts on biodiversity.",,
,TARGET 9,"Ensure sustainable management and use of wild species providing social, economic and environmental benefits, especially for vulnerable and dependent people, including through sustainable biodiversity-based activities and protecting customary sustainable use.",,
,TARGET 10,"Ensure sustainable management of agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry through biodiversity-friendly practices including sustainable intensification and agroecological approaches, contributing to resilience, long-term productivity, food security, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance.",,
,TARGET 11,"Restore, maintain and enhance nature’s contributions including regulation of air, water, climate, soil health, pollination, disease risk reduction, protection from natural hazards, through nature-based or ecosystem-based approaches for people and nature's benefit.",,
,TARGET 12,"Significantly increase area, quality, connectivity, access to and benefits from green and blue spaces in urban and densely populated areas by mainstreaming biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, ensuring biodiversity-inclusive urban planning, enhancing native biodiversity, ecological connectivity, human health and well-being, contributing to sustainable urbanization.",,
,TARGET 13,"Take legal, policy, administrative and capacity-building measures to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources, digital sequence information and traditional knowledge, facilitating access and significantly increasing benefits shared by 2030.",,
,TARGET 14,"Integrate biodiversity and its values into policies, regulations, planning, development, poverty eradication, strategic environmental assessments and national accounting, progressively aligning public and private activities, fiscal and financial flows with the Framework's goals.",,
,TARGET 15,"Encourage and enable business, especially large and transnational companies and financial institutions, to monitor, assess, disclose risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity, provide consumer information for sustainable consumption, comply with access and benefit-sharing regulations, thereby reducing negative impacts, increasing positive impacts, and promoting sustainable production patterns.",,
,TARGET 16,"Enable people to make sustainable consumption choices by policy, legislative frameworks, education, access to information and alternatives, aiming to reduce global consumption footprint equitably by 2030, including halving food waste and significantly reducing overconsumption and waste generation.",,
,TARGET 17,"Establish, strengthen and implement biosafety measures and biotechnology handling and benefit distribution in all countries per Articles 8(g) and 19 of the Convention.",,
,TARGET 18,"Identify, eliminate, phase out or reform biodiversity-harmful incentives by 2025, reducing them by at least $500 billion per year by 2030, starting with the most harmful, while scaling up positive incentives for conservation and sustainable use.",,
,TARGET 19,"Substantially and progressively increase financial resources for biodiversity implementation to at least $200 billion per year by 2030 including increasing international aid to developing countries, domestic resource mobilization, leveraging private finance, innovative schemes, optimizing co-benefits of finance for biodiversity and climate crises, and enhancing collective actions and transparency.",,
,TARGET 20,"Strengthen capacity-building, technology transfer and scientific cooperation including joint research and monitoring, especially in developing countries, fostering innovation needed for effective biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.",,
,TARGET 21,"Ensure best available data, information and knowledge are accessible to decision makers, practitioners and public for effective biodiversity governance, participatory management, communication, education, monitoring and research, with traditional knowledge accessed only with free, prior and informed consent.",,
,TARGET 22,"Ensure full, equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive representation and participation in biodiversity decision-making and access to justice and information for indigenous peoples, local communities, women, girls, children, youth, persons with disabilities, and protect environmental human rights defenders.",,
,TARGET 23,"Ensure gender equality in Framework implementation through gender-responsive approaches enabling equal opportunity, capacity, rights, participation and leadership for all women and girls in biodiversity-related actions and decision-making.",,
